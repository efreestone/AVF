			<p id="week1Title" class="title">Week 1 Research Topic</p>
			
			<p>Q1: Less obvious perks of using 'live' data resources include logins and payments. How could Twitter be used in these two
			scenarios?</p>
			
			<p>A1: "Sign in with Twitter" is based on a feature called "OAuth" that opens up authentication and authorization for the app to
			use the API on the users behalf, all while the user never has to give their password to any third party application. This
			security feature opens up a lot of different possibilities for integration. I believe there are a few different options for
			payment with Twitter as well. The one I know of is "Amex Sync". This allows a user to tweet special hash tags and receive special
			deals and discounts on products using their registered American Express card. The transaction is completed over twitter with more
			special hash tags. When you tweet the first tag, the system sends you a unique tag to tweet in order to complete the transaction.
			Although this isn't directly integrated into the Twitter API, its still very secure because the users card info is protected on
			Amex's servers so their info is never out in the open. OAuth helps to close any other cracks in security for the transaction and
			doesn't even allow Amex Sync access to any of the users info that isn't public. One thing I wasn't able to find much info on is
			how vendors join in. Sync is also available for Facebook and Foursquare but I believe you just get coupons from them and can only
			make purchases via Twitter as of now. I wasn't able to find any other similar services either, but I wouldn't be surprised to see
			other Credit Card companies jump on the bandwagon if Sync does well. I don't think it would be extremely difficult to create a
			mashup of Twitter and a payment API such as Paypal either.</p>
			
			<p>Q2: Visit Programmableweb.com and search for JSON-P data sources. Why would we need JSON-P, specifically?</p>
			
			<p>A2: We would need JSON-P specifically because it is one of the easiest ways for cross-domain communication. This opens up
			doors for all kinds of different mashups.</p>
			
			<p>Q3: Based on the JSON-P search results: what data resource(s) do you think might pair well with which types of Native device
			features?</p>
			
			<p>A3: One of the first resources that jumps out to me would be the Google Maps API paired with the Native Geolocation feature.
			This is one of the features I will be demoing this month, however I am not sure if I will use the Google API as of yet. There are
			several other map APIs available so I will be research them first as one may better suit my needs.</p>
			
			<p>Q4: Please describe any design and functionality intentions you may have for your Demo app components this month.</p>
			
			<p>A4: I am looking to build a wish list/gift idea app and this months demo app will be the core features of it. One of the main
			features would be to allow the user to take pictures of an item they want or they think would be a good gift for another person
			and share it with their contacts, on Twitter, or on Facebook. The image would contain geolocation to keep track of where the
			image was taken, possibly with some sort of map integration and the ability to add captions to the post or notes (or a voice
			recording) about the item that wouldn't be visible on the image post. In the future, I also hope to add the ability to shop for a
			specific item via Google Shopping or Amazon from within the app. One thing I think would really help the shopping portion would
			be bar code and QR code reading so the user can just snap a picture of the code and get the price of the item from several
			retailers.</p>
			
			<p>Q5: Briefly describe some past 'lessons learned' regarding workflow as it relates to research, design, development, etc.</p>
			
			<p>A5: One lesson I've learned is to always have a game plan before really diving in. If you know the basics about what you need,
			you can plan the workflow much better and avoid having to go back to research once you?ve moved on to the design phase. There
			have been a few times where I had to do this and it can really wreak havoc on your workflow, especially if you?re the type of
			person that has to be in a particular ?mode? for the individual parts like me. </p>

			<p>Q1: What are some of the ways that you could change your HTML on your Demo app to be more accessible? (Remember, you can use
			the Section tag with jQuery, for instance)</p>
			
			<p>A1: After doing some reading on screen readers and accessibility, it became very apparent that semantic markup is extremely
			important. One thing I can do (beyond being extra careful with meaningful markup) is to ensure everything is properly labeled.
			After running one of my gh-pages from project 2 in the accessibility validator at 
			<a class="link" href="http://wave.webaim.org/">wave.webaim.org</a> (only validates web addresses, no text option), the majority of
			errors were related to labeling. There are probably different sections of my app that a different tag would be more appropriate as
			well. There is an extensive list of accessibility tools at 
			<a class="link" href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/RC/tools/complete">w3.org/WAI/RC/tools/complete</a> that should come in handing for
			writing more accessible markup.</p>
			
			<p>Q2: Visit a video service on the web (like YouTube) and search for "Screen Reader Demo" and "Mobile Screen Reader" - what are
			some of the common frustrations (or common support mechanisms) that you see among the examples that are given - how could you fix
			them (or use them)?</p>
			
			<p>A2: The top frustration with screen readers and surfing the web is poor markup by far. One video I watched was showing the how
			the accessible version of <em>Amazon.com</em> compared to the regular version. The difference was absolutely huge! The standard
			version is basically unusable with a screen reader. Meaningful and semantic markup makes a big difference when it comes to
			accessibility. 
			<br></br>
			I think the largest frustration when it comes to using accessibility software is poor layout and extremely different layouts
			between different brands. Features such as shortcuts should be easy to find but some screen readers have them buried under far
			less important features. Having an extremely simple and intuitive layout seems like it should be a given for accessibility
			software, but unfortunately it isn't.
			<br></br>
			Although it only came up in one review, I think the unnatural speech of most screen readers could be troublesome, especially for
			someone who has just recently lost their vision. Making the voice as natural as possible could make a huge difference.</p>
			
			<p>Q3: Devices: Please list two devices (and some of their features) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</p>
			
			<p>A3: Daisy Players such as the <em>Plextalk PTN2</em> are audio playback devices for reading books with the Daisy Reader
			software. Some of the features for most Daisy Players are text-to-speech or narration of books, large tactile buttons with voice
			navigation, a built in speaker and headphone jack. Some even include braille note taking and speech recognition.
			<br></br>
			Refreshable Braille Displays such as the <em>Focus Blue 40,</em> are another device specifically made for accessibility. They
			typically connect to a computer with usb or Bluetooth. The display consists of small pins that come up from a flat and smooth
			surface to create the Braille words for the user. Many of them include various hot keys for volume and navigation as well. </p>
			
			<p>Q4: Mobile Apps: Please list two apps (either Android or iOS, or both) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</p>
			
			<p>A4: <em>Mobile Speak</em> by Code Factory is a screen reader that is available for Symbian, Windows Mobile, and Android. It is
			also included in the <em>Mobile Accessibility Suite</em> that comes with several different apps such as calendar, alarm, braille
			conversion and a gps location feature, among others.
			<br></br>
			<em>Google TalkBack</em> is an accessibility service for Android devices that adds spoken, audible and vibration feedback to a
			device in order to aid navigation. It is pre-installed on most Android devices but can also be added.</p>

			<p>Q1: What are the 'top selling' app categories in the U.S.? Japan? Great Britain?</p>
			
			<p>A1: The top selling app categories in the U.S. are Games, Education, and Entertainment (148apps.com via Statista.com, 2013).
			Utilities (including Navigation) and Social Networking apps also make the top ten in the U.S. The top selling categories in Japan
			seem to be Utilities, Social Networking, and Games, although I was hard pressed to find any real stats for this market. The top
			selling categories in Great Britain are Games, Utilities, and Entertainment. As others have mentioned, I wasn’t able to find a
			list for just Great Britain either. The closest I found is Europe, which includes The UK, Germany, Spain, France, etc. Most of the
			stats I found were for the Apple App Store, but I would assume they are similar for other app stores.</p>
			
			<p>Q2: Based on your three answers above, what might you infer about each of the markets listed?</p>
			
			<p>A2: I was surprised to find out how similar the European market is to the U.S. I wasn’t surprised to find Games among the top
			categories for all three regions. Free, Freemium, and paid games all do well in these markets. Something noteworthy though is the
			most popular Games in Japan are Social Games as apposed to the single player games of the other two regions. Utility apps and
			Social Networking are also very popular for all three as well.</p>
			
			<p>Q3: What is the average cost and bandwidth limits per user (in general) in each of the three markets? How may this impact
			development?</p>
			
			<p>A3: I had some trouble finding up to date info on this as well. The best resource I could find is from June of 2011 and it has
			popped up in at least two other posts so far so it may be as good as it gets at the moment. 
			<br></br>
			Prices start at $35/month for 3mbps download and are usually capped around 250-300GB per month (Murphy, 2011). I personally pay
			$65/month for what is supposed to be 20mbps down, but we usually only see 14-16mbps. I do live in a semi-rural area though so I’m
			not really surprised. I believe my service is capped at 250GB.
			<br></br>
			Pricing in Great Britain starts at around $30/month for a 20mbps line. Bandwidth caps depend on the various plans available, some
			even as low as 10GB/month (Murphy, 2011).
			<br></br>
			Information for the prices in Japan is limited but plans range from $48-82/month for up to 50mbps download speeds. There isn’t
			much info on bandwidth caps either but OCN Hikari (an ISP) has a warning posted on their site stating those users who exceed 30GB
			day (yes, 30GB) will be restricted (Murphy, 2011). 
			<br></br>
			As I said before, these figures are a bit dated but it is still fairly accurate (for my area at least) as prices have dropped a
			fairly good chunk recently. Prices can also vary from area to area within any market.
			<br></br>
			As developers, we have to be very careful when it comes to how much data our apps use. We live in a media hungry society and it
			isn't difficult at all to hit our mobile bandwidth caps. Overages can add up very fast, although a lot of carriers are now getting
			rid of overage fees and going with throttling instead, although this doesn't change the importance for us to only use the bare
			minimum data that our apps need.</p>
			
			<p>Q4: And, finally, what would be your suggested strategy in project topic and global market choice? Feel free to have a first
			and second choice.</p>
			
			<p>A4: My main suggestion would be to focus on either Games or Social Networking for these markets, as they are both very popular.
			Utility apps in general also do well so that would be my second suggestion. Regardless of the topic, extra care should be taken to
			localize the application for any of these markets, especially Japan, as it can be a difficult market for outside developers.</p>
